C. Save your "step1.java" as "step3.java" and construct a method "infix2Postfix" that takes infix that you produce in step1 to produce its postfix.
Test your program and print out the postfix. (You may add the output to "out2a.txt" or write to "out2c.txt"
D. Add a method "evaluate" that takes postfix from "infix2Postfix" to produce the result.
